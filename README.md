   This project improves personalized job recommendations using real-world Magnet.me interaction data (2022–2023). It addresses extreme data sparsity (~99.98%) by implementing a Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) model with Matrix Factorization. The workflow included data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search), and evaluation using ranking metrics (NDCG, Recall, Precision, MRR). Code versioning and experiment tracking were managed via GitHub, while model performance and tuning results were monitored and logged using NeptuneAI.
